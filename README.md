# single-file-php-sharex-server
Hate fancy interfaces? me too! this sharex uploader is meant to be as easy as edit and go!

simple instructions

edit uploadb.php

its pretty self explanatory on what to change

you need to chmod the directory you want your files to go into

if you have issues with file size (it will throw a chmod or post error and not actually tell you) add the htaccess file or edit your server's config

you might need to edit nginx config for it to accept htaccess files (no I wont help you with this check stackoverflow)

apache will (usually) support htaccess files
